    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>“I write to remember. I write to resist. I write to reclaim what history has tried to erase.”</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome! I’m Madison "Maddie P." Petaway, a poet, performer, and workshop host from Houston, Texas. My writing blends the deeply personal with history, focusing on memory, community, and resistance.</p>
